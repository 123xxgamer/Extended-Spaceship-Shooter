# Extended Spaceship Shooter
My take on a classic spaceship shooter. Check it out [here](https://123xxgamer.github.io/Extended-Spaceship-Shooter/spaceshipShooter.html)!

Click setup first, then click Go and play with WASD to move and K to shoot.

Game displays helath, lives remaining, current level, current score, and time left in current level.

This model takes some inspiration from the old flash game [Raiden X](https://flasharch.com/en/archive/play/d005763a45cbf29d3d8512d7db1c4e02), but has plenty of personal touches and modifications.
